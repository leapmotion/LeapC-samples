As of August 2017, the Leap Motion SDK available at https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started
contains a number of examples for directly using the LeapC API. However, the provided Makefile
is intended only for Linux and macOS.

This repository contains a subset of the Leap Motion SDK, with some of the examples (e.g.
PollingSample, GLUTImageSample) configured to build in Visual Studio 2017 [Community Edition].

Libraries for other Leap Motion APIs including the legacy C++ bindings (Leap.h), LeapJava, and
LeapPython have been removed here.
